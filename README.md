Theremin
========

A [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) built with HTML5 and JavaScript. It uses the canvas element and the web audio API.

#### Directions

Point and click anywhere on the screen to play a sound, then move up or down to change the pitch. The left side of canvas will produce a sine sound wave while the right side produces a sawtooth sound wave.


#### Cross browser / device compatibility

Theremin should work in all modern browsers except for IE. It works with touch screen devices and is responsive.

#### Credits

[WAD.js](https://github.com/rserota/wad) is the libray used for audio manipulation, its like jQuery for your ears!
