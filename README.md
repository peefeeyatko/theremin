Theremin
========

A thermin built with HTML5 and JavScript. It uses the canvas element and the web audio API.

#### Directions

Point and click anywhere on the screen to play a sound, then move up or down to change the pitch. The left side of canvas will produce a sine sound wave while the right side produces a sawtooth sound wave.


#### Cross browser / device compatability

Theremin should work on all modern browsers except for IE. Works with touch screen devices and is responsive.

#### Credit

WAD.js is the libray used for audio manipulation, its like jQuery for your ears!
